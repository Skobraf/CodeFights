Task 1: 

	The statistics from the past ten years shows that the number of crime is increasing too fast, and in some societies, the number of crimes committed by teenagers is growing faster. I believe that the easy access to violent movies and videos from teenagers is one of the main reasons for this phenomena. Also, we find out this number is higher in poor countries. We also can't deny the role of education is very important, but often the number of crime increase where teenagers don't finish there education.
	I believe that it's every body's responsibilities to raise the awareness of this dangers and all society should put hands together to help our generation to follow the right path and get far from the crime path
